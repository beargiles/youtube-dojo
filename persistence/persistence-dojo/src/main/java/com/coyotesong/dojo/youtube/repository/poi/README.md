Excel-based Repository
=

This repository uses the standard Excel (xlsx) format for persistence.
It is primarily intended for developers and testers since this is a
human-friendly format.

This format is also useful when we need to load information provided by
the 'business side' of the shop. This may be less common than before (see:
Google docs) but Excel or LibreOffice are still widely used.
